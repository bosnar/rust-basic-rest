# Rust Basic REST API with Axum

This repository contains a **mini REST API** built using the [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework in Rust. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Rust by developing a basic web service that demonstrates key concepts such as request handling, routing, and CRUD operations.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Handling:** Support for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete for a simple resource
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error responses and status codes
- **Project Structure:** Follow best practices for organizing Rust web applications
- **Lightweight Framework:** Use of Axum for building efficient APIs
